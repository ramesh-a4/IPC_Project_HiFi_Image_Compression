# IPC_Project_HiFi_Image_Compression
Hifi Image compression project

This project details the principles, architecture, and implementation of High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression (HiFiC), a state-of-the-art neural compres-sion model developed by Google and presented at NeurIPS 2020. Traditional image codecs and earlier deep learning methods, optimized solely for Mean Squared Error (MSE), inevitably produce blurry or artifact-ridden images at low bitrates. HiFiC addresses this limitation by integrating a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) into the learned compression framework. This approach shifts the optimization paradigm from minimizing raw pixel error (distortion) to minimizing perceptual loss, resulting in reconstructed images that are subjectively preferred by human observers, often at significantly lower bitrates than established standards like BPG. The specific implementation reviewed is a low-memory, PyTorch-based reproduc-tion skeleton designed for efficient training on resource-constrained hardware, such as GPUs with limited memory capacity.
